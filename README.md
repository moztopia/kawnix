# Kawnix PHP Framework
## Overview
Dabbling .. writing my own PHP Framework in an effort to better understand the PHP core. The goal is .. simply to get better at PHP. I consider myself a PHP expert now, but there is always room for growth. This interface will only ever process PHP files. If ... and it is a big if ... I get comfortable with it, I might use it in a package to function as a lightweight API server.

## Installation
Right now you have to composer require kawnix/framework to get this running and it is clunky; to say the least.

## Next Steps
I am going to create a compsoer create-project interface for this so it can be rapidly installed and tested.
